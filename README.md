Hello J2ObjC
============

Sample project that is as simple as possible, HelloWorld. 

Uses IDEA, [J2ObjC](http://j2objc.org/), and [j2objc-gradle](https://github.com/j2objc-contrib/j2objc-gradle) plugin, and includes required libs. 

NOTE all steps to setup, etc

NOTE approach - use j2objc-gradle to create a STATIC LIBRARY
then include that library in an iOS project manually (plugin xcode doesn't work, building the library/java from xcode is dumb)

NOTE iOS dir

NOTE libs version of j2objc-gradle plugin
